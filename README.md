Presentations on RNA Seq Power Analysis and Chip Seq 

The Chip Seq stuff is in collaboration with Alon Goren.
The RNA Seq stuff is in collaboration with Gabor Marth's lab and Broad Technology Labs, mostly Joshua Levin.

Don't use it without citing me unless I tell you you can. 

If you are looking to understand basic RNA Seq design don't use the presentations. Use this Tumblr post:

This is a long presentation that is mostly about RNA Seq power analysis and experimental design. I gave it to the CS and bio department at UMass Boston (which has the most beautiful campus and has some really great people). This contains most of the Scotty Supplement, which is good as it's not working on the publisher's site.

This is a shorter one:

That was from a Broad training day on RNA Seq, a subset of what I spoke about to UMass. 

BioITWorldBusby2016_2.pptx - A presentation to Bio IT world (which was not that good) The theme of this is how improving the data > improving the algorithm (and a little bit of advertising for Broad Tech Labs products which you should totally buy). There is my brief history of tech dev!  It has some background slides on ChipSeq that might be useful.

Our ChIP Seq paper is pretty basic, first principles tech dev stuff and might be useful if you haven't done ChipSeq:

One important point to know is that different antibodies will give measurably different results because they attack different small pieces of the thing they are targeting. This makes ChipSeq similar to RNA Seq but I think a lot harder to understand and interpret. Figure 5 of our paper shows that using the ENCODE genome segmentations, which are fantastic. You should totally look at them if you're into ChIP Seq.
